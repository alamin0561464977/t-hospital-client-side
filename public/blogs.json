Mad about you baby, yeah, I’m mad about you. Whoo hoo hoo.On November 13, Felix Unger was asked to remove himself from his place of residence. That request came from his wife. Deep down, he knew she was right, but he also knew that someday, he would return to her. With nowhere else to go, he appeared at the home of his childhood friend, Oscar Madison. Sometime earlier, Madison’s wife had thrown him out, requesting that he never return. Can two divorced men share an apartment without driving each other crazy? Making your way in the world today takes everything you’ve got. Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn’t you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they’re always glad you came. You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows your name. You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, you wanna go where everybody knows your name.",

When you can walk its length and leave no trace. You will have learned. There once was a story about a man who could turn invisible. I thought it was only a story… until it happened to me. Ok, so here’s how it works: there’s this stuff called Quicksilver that can bend light. Some scientist made it into a synthetic gland, and that’s where I came in. See, I was facing life in prison and they were looking for a human experiment. So, we made a deal. They put the gland in my brain; I walk free. The operation was a success… but that’s where everything started to go wrong. Man lives in the sunlit world of what he believes to be reality. But, there is, unseen by most, an underworld, a place that is just as real, but not as brightly lit… a darkside. The darkside is always there, waiting for us to enter, waiting to enter us. So until next time, try to enjoy the daylight. We got a right to pick a little fight, Bonanza! If anyone fights anyone of us, he’s gotta fight with me! We’re not a one to saddle up and run, Bonanza!

If anyone fights anyone of us he’s gotta fight with me! ",
